The project was to build out a system that solved the issue of driver students not passing their tests. It's a platform to help review tests, schedule practice driving lessons and track student progress. I feel like I did everything in this project well, particularly the UML diagrams. I was able to clearly interprate customer/system needs and figure out how to build these out into case diagrams and overall class functionality. If i could redo some parts however, I might spend more time on the diagrams and make them more comprehensive. It's a lot of work to do for one person ona project of this size but i think it'd be great practice to do everything to really get a solid overview of how everything needs to flow. User needs are very very important to building a project since this is what will make or break an app. Having beena  user of many many different apps in my life, it's somewhat easy to determine what is most efective and what I'd like to see personally.
